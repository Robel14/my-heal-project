                  experience spanning over three decades. As a US citizen born in Ethiopia, she holds a BA in Social

                  encompasses a rich tapestry of roles within both public and private institutions.

                  Mentuab's impactful initiatives extended to fostering business relations between Africa and Georgia,
                  evidenced by her coordination and organization of the United Nations Industrial Development
                  Organization (UNIDO) workshop in Atlanta in January 1990.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Returning to Ethiopia after two decades in the US, Mentuab sought to assist a country grappling with
                  civil war and famine. Her efforts brought foreign investment, notably the BGI group, which now owns
                  breweries and a winery, contributing to the nation's economic revival.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  However, Mentuab's transformative journey took a new direction when she realized her true calling lay
                  in aiding those in need. This realization prompted her return to the US, where she conceived the idea
                  of establishing a credible NGO in Ethiopia. Drawing from her extensive experience volunteering with
                  international and local NGOs in Atlanta, she founded Helping Ethiopia Achieve Longevity (HEAL),
                  formerly known as Nutrition plus Holistic Home Care (NPHHC), in September 2003.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  As the founding volunteer Executive Director, Mentuab played a pivotal role in HEAL's inception. Since
                  its establishment, HEAL has positively impacted over 1.3 million lives, focusing on HIV/AIDS, Climate,
                  Women and Youth Empowerment, and Hospice Care, Maternal Neonatal Health, embodying her unwavering
                  commitment to humanitarian causes.
