                    In the rural communities of Oromia Region, access to quality maternal healthcare has historically
                    been limited, leading to high rates of maternal and infant mortality. Our Maternal Health Initiative
                    has transformed this reality for thousands of women and their families.

                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">The Challenge</h2>
                  <p>
                    When we began working in the Oromia Region in 2018, we found that only 15% of women were delivering
                    their babies with skilled birth attendants present. Many women had to walk more than 10 kilometers
                    to reach the nearest health facility, often in difficult terrain. Traditional practices, while
                    culturally important, sometimes posed risks to maternal and infant health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Limited awareness about the importance of antenatal care, combined with shortages of trained
                    healthcare workers and essential supplies, created a challenging environment for safe motherhood.
                  </p>

                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4 mt-8">Our Approach</h2>
                  <p>
                    Working closely with the Ministry of Health and local communities, we implemented a comprehensive
                    maternal health program with several key components:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
                    <li>
                      <strong>Infrastructure Improvements:</strong> Renovated and equipped 5 health centers with
                      maternal health facilities, including delivery rooms and essential equipment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Healthcare Worker Training:</strong> Trained 30 healthcare workers in emergency obstetric
                      care and 50 traditional birth attendants in safe delivery practices and referral protocols
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Community Health Workers:</strong> Recruited and trained 45 community health workers to
                      conduct home visits, provide education, and facilitate referrals
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Established women's groups in 25 villages to discuss
                      maternal health issues and develop local solutions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Transportation Solutions:</strong> Created an emergency transport system using locally
                      available vehicles to help women reach health facilities during labor
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                        treat us with respect, and I've had three healthy children with their help."

                    Beyond these statistics, the program has transformed attitudes and practices around maternal health.
                    Women now have greater knowledge about their health rights and needs, and communities actively
                    support maternal health initiatives.

                  </div>
                  <p>
                    Halima, a 28-year-old mother of four, experienced dangerous complications during her first three
                    deliveries, all of which took place at home. When she became pregnant with her fourth child, a
                    community health worker visited her regularly, educating her about the importance of antenatal care
                    and facility-based delivery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During her eighth month of pregnancy, Halima developed high blood pressure. Thanks to regular
                    check-ups at the health center, this was detected early, and she received appropriate care. When she
                    went into labor, the emergency transport system quickly brought her to the health center, where
                    skilled providers managed her delivery safely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "I never knew that giving birth could be so different," says Halima. "With my previous children, I
                    was in pain for days, and I feared for my life. This time, I felt safe and cared for. My baby and I
                    are healthy, and I tell all the women in my village to go to the health center."
                  </p>

                  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4 mt-8">Looking Forward</h2>
                  <p>
                    Building on the success of this initiative, we are expanding the program to additional districts in
                    the Oromia Region. We're also developing enhanced components focused on adolescent reproductive
                    health and nutrition during pregnancy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The local health authorities have integrated many of the program's approaches into their standard
                    practices, ensuring sustainability. Community ownership remains strong, with village health
                    committees taking increasing responsibility for maternal health promotion.
