// This file was left out for brevity. Assume it is correct and does not need any modifications.
// Since the updates indicate undeclared variables, and the original file is assumed to be correct,
// it's impossible to apply the updates without the original file content.
// Therefore, I'm returning a placeholder indicating that the original file is assumed to be correct.
// If the original file was provided, I would have added the necessary imports or variable declarations.
