          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">Our Story</h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700">
            Founded in 2010 by a group of Ethiopian diaspora professionals and friends of Ethiopia, Heal Ethiopia began
            with a simple mission: to contribute to the sustainable development of Ethiopia by mobilizing resources and
            expertise.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-8 text-gray-700">
            What started as small-scale community projects has grown into a comprehensive development organization with
            programs across multiple regions of Ethiopia, touching thousands of lives each year.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">Our Approach</h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700">
            We believe in community-driven development. All our projects are designed and implemented with active
            participation from local communities, ensuring that solutions are culturally appropriate and sustainable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-8 text-gray-700">
            By partnering with local organizations, government agencies, and international NGOs, we leverage collective
            expertise and resources to maximize our impact and reach.
